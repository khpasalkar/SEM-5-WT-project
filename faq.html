Q What is medical reimbursement account?<br>
A Medical Reimbursement Account referred to as a health reimbursement account, is an IRS-approved, employer-funded, tax-advantaged employer health benefit plan that reimburses employees for out-of-pocket medical expenses and individual health insurance premiums.<br>
<hr>
Q How far back can I submit a claim for reimbursement?<br>
A You can typically submit a claim any time during your benefit plan year. For example, if your benefit plan year runs from January through December and you visit the doctor shortly after your plan year starts in January, you have through December to request reimbursement. Some plans give you extra time to submit claims past the end of the plan year. This is called a run-out date or grace period. <br>
<hr>
Q How to set up a medical reimbursement account?<br>
A Step 1 - The Employer sets employee eligibility requirements, decides what expenses are eligible for reimbursement, and determines the monthly or annual HRA contribution amounts.<br>
Step 2 - The Employer enrolls Employees into the plan and distributes IRS/ERISA/ACA required plan documents, SPDs and notices to each eligible Employee.<br>
Step 3 - Each Employee chooses and pays for his or her own individual health insurance policy and submits proper documentation for reimbursement.<br>
Step 4 - A HIPAA-compliant claims processor reviews the reimbursement request and approves or rejects the request.<br>
Step 5 - If the request is approved, the Employer reimburses the Employee for the approved reimbursement up to the balance of each Empoyee's HRA.<br>
